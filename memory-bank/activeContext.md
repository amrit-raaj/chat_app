# Active Context

## Current Focus
Starting development of the MERN stack chat application. Beginning with project setup and backend authentication system.

## Recent Actions
1. Created comprehensive memory bank documentation
2. Established project requirements and technical architecture
3. Ready to begin implementation phase

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create root package.json for monorepo management
   - Set up client/ directory for React frontend
   - Set up server/ directory for Node.js backend
   - Initialize both frontend and backend with their respective package.json files

2. **Backend Foundation**
   - Install core dependencies (express, mongoose, socket.io, etc.)
   - Create basic Express server structure
   - Set up MongoDB connection
   - Implement user authentication system (register/login)

3. **Database Models**
   - Create User model with email/password fields
   - Create Message model for chat messages
   - Create Conversation model for chat rooms

## Active Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Using client/ and server/ directories in single repository
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies for security
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket communication
- **UI Framework**: Will decide between Material-UI and Tailwind CSS during frontend setup

## Current Priorities
1. **Security First**: Implement robust authentication before chat features
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Set up proper separation of concerns
3. **Development Experience**: Configure hot reloading and development scripts
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear code documentation and API structure

## Implementation Notes
- Starting with backend to establish data models and API endpoints
- Will use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Planning to implement file upload capabilities after basic messaging works
- Responsive design will be implemented with mobile-first approach

## Key Patterns to Follow
- RESTful API design for HTTP endpoints
- Event-driven architecture for real-time features
- Component-based architecture for React frontend
- Middleware pattern for authentication and validation
- Error-first callback pattern for Node.js operations

## Development Environment Setup
- Node.js and npm should be available
- MongoDB will be used (local development, Atlas for production)
- VS Code with appropriate extensions for MERN development
- Git for version control
