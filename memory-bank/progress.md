- [ ] Add message search functionality
- [ ] Implement emoji support

## Current Status
**Phase**: Authentication System 95% Complete
**Next Milestone**: Database setup and full authentication testing
**Estimated Completion**: Complete working chat app - 2-3 hours remaining

## Known Issues
- MongoDB not installed/running locally (need to set up database)
- Authentication endpoints not yet tested with database
- Chat messaging functionality not yet implemented

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: Monorepo structure with client/ and server/ directories
2. **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies
4. **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket communication
5. **Frontend**: React with functional components and hooks

## Pending Decisions
1. **UI Framework**: Material-UI vs Tailwind CSS (will decide during frontend setup)
2. **File Storage**: Local storage vs cloud storage (starting with local)
3. **Deployment**: Platform selection (Heroku, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
4. **Database Hosting**: Local MongoDB vs MongoDB Atlas

## Development Notes
- Following security-first approach with authentication implementation
- Planning to implement features incrementally with testing at each phase
- Maintaining documentation throughout development process
- Using environment variables for configuration management
